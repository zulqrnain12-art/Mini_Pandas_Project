# Features
This project includes the following features:

Data Loading and Inspection: Efficiently load data and perform initial data checks.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.
Data Transformation: Perform operations such as filtering, grouping, merging, and aggregating data.
Statistical Analysis: Calculate descriptive statistics and derive insights.
Data Export: Save the cleaned and transformed data to new files for further use.

# Installation
To set up this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash

# Usage
After setting up, you can start using the project. Here’s a brief example of how to use the functions or scripts in this mini project.

python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from project_module import data_cleaning_function, analysis_function

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Clean data
cleaned_data = data_cleaning_function(data)

# Perform analysis
analysis_result = analysis_function(cleaned_data)

# Display the result
print(analysis_result)

# Examples
Here are some example use cases included in the project:

Data Cleaning: Removing null values and duplicates.
Transformation: Aggregating data by specific categories to derive insights.
Statistical Analysis: Calculating mean, median, and other statistics.
Provide screenshots or code snippets if possible, demonstrating key functionalities in action.
